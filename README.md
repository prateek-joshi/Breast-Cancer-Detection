# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Techniques
## Background
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, impacting 2.1 million women each year, and also causes the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. In 2018, it is estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer – that is approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women (as taken from WHO). Early detection of breast cancer is possible using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods.
